**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Service:** fido-clickup-routing-staging  
**Environment:** Railway Production (staging branch)

---

## Test Execution Summary

### Security Tests: 3/3 Automated Tests PASSED

| Test | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Alert Trigger Mechanism | ✅ PASS | Slack alert received |
| Health Endpoints | ✅ PASS | Both endpoints operational |
| HMAC Validation | ✅ PASS | Signatures validated correctly |

---

## Detailed Results

### Test 1: Alert Trigger Mechanism

**Objective:** Verify security alerting system triggers on high 401 rate

**Method:**
- Sent 21 invalid signature requests within 5 minutes
- Threshold: 20 failures in 5-minute window
- Alert cooldown: 15 minutes

**Results:**
- ✅ All 21 requests returned 401 (as expected)
- ✅ Alert triggered after 20th failure
- ✅ Slack message posted to channel C09NVLUNDL4
- ✅ Alert included:
  - Service name: fido-clickup-routing-staging
  - Failure count: 20 in 5 minutes
  - Unique IPs: 7
  - Top failure reason: invalid_signature (20 occurrences)
  - Possible causes listed
  - Cooldown notice: 15 minutes

**Evidence:**
- Slack screenshot showing alert message
- Alert timestamp: 2025-10-26T21:18:07.191Z
- `/ready` endpoint showing alerting_enabled: true

**Conclusion:** PASSED - Alerting system working as designed

### Test 2: Health Endpoints

**Objective:** Verify health check and readiness endpoints

**Method:**
- GET /health
- GET /ready

**Results:**

**/health endpoint:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "fido-clickup-routing-staging",
  "uptime": 153,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-26T21:16:26.887Z"
}
```

**/ready endpoint:**
```json
{
  "status": "ready",
  "service": "fido-clickup-routing-staging",
  "uptime": 46,
  "environment": {
    "node_version": "v22.11.0",
    "platform": "linux"
  },
  "security": {
    "alerting_enabled": true,
    "alert_channel": "C09NVLUNDL4",
    "recent_401s": 0,
    "alert_threshold": 20
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-26T21:24:08.001Z"
}
```

**Validation:**
- ✅ Both endpoints return 200 OK
- ✅ Health status: "healthy"
- ✅ Ready status: "ready"
- ✅ Security configuration visible
- ✅ Alerting enabled and configured
- ✅ Environment information present

**Conclusion:** PASSED - Health endpoints operational

### Test 3: HMAC Validation

**Objective:** Verify HMAC-SHA256 signature validation

**Method:**
- Generated test payload
- Computed HMAC signature using WEBHOOK_HMAC_SECRET
- Sent POST request with X-Signature header

**Test Payload:**
```json
{
  "event": "taskCreated",
  "task_id": "hmac_debug_test_1761514116634",
  "webhook_id": "debug_test"
}
```

**HMAC Computation:**
- Algorithm: HMAC-SHA256
- Secret: 9a70d8e7fc36b063f19386609d6fd64dc09921a23d8a1c5bb8d1489bb6ddaa1d
- Generated signature: 85d13db3ca2274e9fd25e7acd96ad1e8eea3808b74a23ea5cdab17d35b727556
- Signature length: 64 characters (hex)

**Results:**
- ✅ Request with valid signature: Accepted (passed 401 check)
- ✅ Request with invalid signature: Rejected with 401
- ✅ Missing signature: Rejected with 401
- ✅ Timing-safe comparison working
- ✅ Header normalization working (accepts x-signature and X-Signature)

**Evidence:**
- Debug test output showing signature validation
- Railway logs showing "Signature validated successfully"
- 401 responses for invalid signatures

**Conclusion:** PASSED - HMAC validation working correctly

## Rate Limiting Status

**Configuration:**
- Feature flag: ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING = false (disabled for testing)
- Burst limit: 10 requests/second
- Sustain limit: 2 requests/second
- Window: 1 second

**Status:** Disabled via feature flag (as intended for testing)

**Verification:**
- Service accepts rapid requests without 429 errors
- Feature flag working as expected

## Test Limitations

**Routing Tests:**
- Automated routing tests require real ClickUp tasks
- Synthetic task IDs return 404 from ClickUp API
- Full routing validation requires manual testing with real data

**Recommendation:**
- Execute manual routing tests using guide in `phase4_manual_test_guide.md`
- Create real tasks in ClickUp staging lists
- Collect evidence of routing behavior
- Validate all routing scenarios (VIP, standard, market-based)

## Next Steps

1. Execute manual routing tests (7 scenarios)
2. Collect evidence (screenshots, logs)
3. Complete Phase 4 Pulse Report
4. Submit to Winston for review
