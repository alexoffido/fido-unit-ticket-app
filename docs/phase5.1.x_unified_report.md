---

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow (End-to-End)

```
1. User submits /fido-ops-ticket in Slack
   ‚Üì
2. Modal opens with emoji-enhanced fields
   ‚Üì
3. User fills form and uploads photos (optional)
   ‚Üì
4. Submission triggers app.js handler
   ‚Üì
5. Slack message posted to #fido-cx
   - Header: "ATTN: @cx The Ops team has reported a new issue..."
   - Fields: Subject, Ticket ID, Property, Market, Issue Type, Priority
   - BARK Link: "*View Service in BARK*" (if provided)
   - Photos: Clickable links (if provided)
   ‚Üì
6. ClickUp task created via ClickUp service
   - List: CLICKUP_LIST_ID_ISSUE
   - Name: [OPS] FO-YYYYMMDD-XXXX ‚Ä¢ Subject
   - Description: All fields + photo URLs
   ‚Üì
7. Photos uploaded as ClickUp attachments (Phase 5.1.2)
   - Download from Slack using bot token
   - Upload to ClickUp via multipart/form-data
   - Best-effort: log failures, continue on error
   ‚Üì
8. Success confirmation sent to user
   - Ephemeral message with Slack thread link
   - ClickUp task link (if creation succeeded)
```

### Component Interactions

**app.js (Main Handler):**
- Defines `opsTicketModal()` with emoji-enhanced fields
- Handles modal submission in `app.view('fido_ops_ticket_modal')`
- Processes photo uploads via Slack files.info API
- Calls ClickUp service for task creation
- Calls ClickUp service for photo attachment upload

**services/clickup.js (ClickUp Integration):**
- `createTask('ops', ...)` - Creates task with all fields
- `_listForType('ops')` - Routes to CLICKUP_LIST_ID_ISSUE
- `_buildPayload(...)` - Builds task payload with ops-specific format
- `attachFilesToTask(...)` - Uploads photos as attachments (Phase 5.1.2)

**Environment Variables:**
- `SLACK_SUBTEAM_CX` - CX usergroup ID for mentions
- `SLACK_SUBTEAM_BP_OPS` - BP Ops usergroup ID for mentions
- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` - For downloading private Slack files
- `CLICKUP_API_TOKEN` - For creating tasks and uploading attachments
- `CLICKUP_LIST_ID_ISSUE` - Target list for Ops tickets

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Overall Risk Level: LOW

All changes are additive (no deletions) and follow existing patterns. Best-effort implementations ensure graceful degradation.

### Specific Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Photo attachment upload fails | Photos not visible in ClickUp | Medium | Fallback to Slack URLs in description |
| Slack mention doesn't notify | CX team misses tickets | Low | Env vars validated, fallback to plaintext |
| ClickUp task creation fails | No task tracking | Low | Error logged, Slack message still posts |
| FormData library incompatibility | Attachment upload crashes | Very Low | Wrapped in try-catch, logs error |
| Rate limiting from ClickUp | Some attachments fail | Low | 150ms delay between uploads |

### Monitoring & Alerting

**Recommended:**
1. Set up Railway log monitoring for "Photo attachment upload" warnings
2. Track ClickUp task creation success rate (should be >99%)
3. Monitor Slack notification delivery (ask CX team for feedback)
4. Alert on repeated attachment upload failures

---

## Performance Impact

### Expected Performance

**Ticket Submission Time:**
- Before: ~2 seconds (Slack message + ClickUp task)
- After: ~2-4 seconds (+ photo attachment upload)
- Per photo overhead: ~500ms (download + upload + delay)

**Example:**
- 0 photos: 2 seconds (unchanged)
- 2 photos: 3 seconds (+1 second)
- 5 photos: 4.5 seconds (+2.5 seconds)

**User Impact:** Minimal - submission still feels instant

### Resource Usage

**Memory:**
- Photo downloads held in memory temporarily
- Max 5 photos √ó ~5MB = ~25MB peak usage
- Acceptable for Railway service

**Network:**
- Additional API calls: 2 per photo (Slack download + ClickUp upload)
- Bandwidth: Proportional to photo size
- No impact on other users (async processing)

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Iterative Approach:** Breaking work into 3 phases allowed for focused testing
2. **Clear Requirements:** Winston's documents provided precise specifications
3. **Backward Compatibility:** Fallbacks ensured no breaking changes
4. **Best-Effort Design:** Photo uploads don't block ticket creation
5. **Comprehensive Documentation:** 1,000+ lines of docs for future reference

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Testing Infrastructure:** Lack of automated tests means manual testing required
2. **Staging Environment:** Testing in production increases risk
3. **Environment Variable Management:** Manual Railway dashboard updates needed
4. **Error Monitoring:** No automated alerting for failures
5. **Code Review:** Single-person implementation (no peer review)

### Recommendations for Future Phases

1. **Add Integration Tests**
   - Test ticket submission flows end-to-end
   - Mock Slack and ClickUp APIs
   - Verify photo attachment upload logic

2. **Implement Staging Environment**
   - Deploy to staging first
   - Run automated tests
   - Promote to production after verification

3. **Centralize Configuration**
   - Create config validation module
   - Check all required env vars on startup
   - Provide clear error messages for missing vars

4. **Set Up Error Monitoring**
   - Integrate with error tracking service (Sentry, Rollbar)
   - Alert on repeated failures
   - Track error rates over time

5. **Implement Feature Flags**
   - Toggle photo attachments on/off without deployment
   - A/B test new features
   - Quick rollback if issues arise
