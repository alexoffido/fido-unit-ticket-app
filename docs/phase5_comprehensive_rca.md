**Document Purpose:** Detailed post-mortem analysis for future Manus AI reference and team learning  
**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Duration:** 3 hours (21:00 CDT Oct 26 → 00:00 CDT Oct 27)  
**Outcome:** Successful deployment with full functionality restored

---

## Timeline of Events

### Hour 1: Initial Deployment (21:00-22:00 CDT)

**21:00** - Phase 5 deployment initiated. User requested production deployment following Phase 4 testing success.

**21:15** - Merged `feature/clickup-os-v2` to `main` branch. Generated new production HMAC secret. Created deployment documentation.

**21:30** - User copied staging environment to create production environment in Railway. Changed connected branch from `feature/clickup-os-v2` back to `main`.

**21:45** - Discovered that `railway.json` configuration exists in repository with hardcoded start command: `node services/webhooks/staging/index.js`

**Key Decision:** Proceeded with deployment assuming railway.json would work for both services.

### Hour 2: Slash Command Failure Discovery (22:00-23:00 CDT)

**22:00** - User reported `/fido-issue` slash command failing with `dispatch_failed` error.

**22:10** - Investigation revealed two separate services in codebase:
- `app.js` - Slack Bolt application (slash commands, modals, interactive components)
- `services/webhooks/staging/index.js` - ClickUp webhook router (auto-routing logic)

**22:20** - Root cause identified: `railway.json` forced both Railway services to run the same start command, causing the Slack bot service (heartfelt-balance) to run the webhook router instead of `app.js`.

**22:30** - Created comprehensive RCA document for Winston's review outlining three solution options.

**22:45** - Winston approved solution: Remove `railway.json` and configure services independently.

### Hour 3: Configuration Fix and New Issues (23:00-00:00 CDT)

**23:00** - Removed `railway.json` from repository. Configured independent start commands via Railway API.

**23:10** - Both services redeployed successfully. Health checks passed. Slack URLs updated.

**23:20** - User tested `/fido-issue` - modal opened successfully, but ClickUp task creation failed with error: "⚠️ ClickUp task creation failed. Create manually if needed."

**23:30** - Created debug endpoint `/debug/clickup-test` and enhanced logging with `DEBUG_CLICKUP` flag.

**23:40** - Debug endpoint revealed error: `"fetch is not defined"` - Node.js version incompatibility discovered.

**23:50** - Created `nixpacks.toml` to force Railway to use Node 18. Service redeployed.

**23:55** - Debug endpoint test successful. ClickUp task created. User tested `/fido-issue` - full end-to-end success.

**00:00** - Production deployment complete. All systems operational.

## Root Cause Analysis by Issue

### Issue 1: Railway.json Configuration Conflict

#### Symptoms
- Slash command `/fido-issue` returned `dispatch_failed` error
- Slack bot service (heartfelt-balance) health endpoint returned `{"service":"fido-clickup-routing-staging"}` instead of expected Slack bot response
- Slack endpoints `/slack/commands` and `/slack/interactive` returned 404 errors

#### Root Cause
Railway applies `railway.json` configuration globally to all services deployed from the same repository. The configuration file contained:

```json
{
  "startCommand": "node services/webhooks/staging/index.js"
}
```

This forced both the Slack bot service and webhook router service to execute the same start command, overriding the intended `node app.js` command for the Slack bot.

#### Why It Happened
- **Assumption Error:** Assumed Railway would use service-specific settings over repository-level configuration
- **Documentation Gap:** Railway's behavior with `railway.json` in multi-service deployments was not well understood
- **Testing Gap:** Did not verify service start command after initial deployment

#### Fix Applied
1. Removed `railway.json` from repository (`git rm railway.json`)
2. Configured start commands independently via Railway service settings
3. Verified both services running correct applications via health endpoint responses

#### Prevention for Future
- **Never use global railway.json** for multi-service deployments
- **Always verify** service start commands via health endpoints after deployment
- **Document** Railway configuration behavior in project README

---

### Issue 2: Node.js Version Incompatibility

#### Symptoms
- ClickUp task creation failed with generic error message
- Debug endpoint revealed: `"error": "fetch is not defined"`
- Service health checks passed, but ClickUp integration non-functional

#### Root Cause
The ClickUpService (`services/clickup.js`) uses the native `fetch()` API, which was introduced in Node.js 18. Railway's default Node.js version was 16.x, which does not include `fetch()` as a global function.

Code snippet causing the issue:
```javascript
const res = await fetch(`https://api.clickup.com/api/v2/list/${listId}/task`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': this.token, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(payload)
});
```

#### Why It Happened
- **Version Mismatch:** `package.json` specified `"node": ">=16.0.0"` but code required Node 18+
- **Local vs Production:** Development environment likely used Node 18+, masking the issue
- **Dependency Assumption:** Assumed `fetch()` was universally available in modern Node.js

#### Fix Applied
1. Updated `package.json` to require Node 18: `"node": ">=18.0.0"`
2. Created `.nvmrc` file with content `18` for local development consistency
3. Created `nixpacks.toml` to explicitly configure Railway build:
   ```toml
   [phases.setup]
   nixPkgs = ["nodejs-18_x"]
   ```
4. Service redeployed with Node 18, `fetch()` became available

#### Alternative Solutions Considered
- **Use axios instead of fetch:** Would work but adds unnecessary dependency since `fetch()` is native in Node 18+
- **Polyfill fetch:** Adds complexity and maintenance burden
- **Chosen solution:** Upgrade to Node 18 (best practice, future-proof)

#### Prevention for Future
- **Match package.json to code requirements:** If code uses Node 18+ features, require Node 18+ in package.json
- **Test in production-like environment:** Use same Node version locally as production
- **Add runtime checks:** Consider adding startup validation for required APIs

---

### Issue 3: Service Crash from Environment Variable Contamination

#### Symptoms
- heartfelt-balance service returned 502 errors after environment variable changes
- Service failed to start, no health endpoint response
- Railway logs showed startup failures

#### Root Cause
User copied all environment variables from `fido-unit-ticket-app` (webhook router) to `heartfelt-balance` (Slack bot), including webhook-specific variables that were incompatible with the Slack bot service:

- `WEBHOOK_HMAC_SECRET` - Used by webhook router for signature validation
- `ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING` - Feature flag for webhook rate limiting
- `ALERT_CHANNEL_ID` - Webhook-specific alerting configuration

While these variables didn't directly crash the service, the combination of incorrect configuration and potential startup issues caused the service to fail.

#### Why It Happened
- **Convenience over precision:** Copying all variables seemed faster than selecting required ones
- **Lack of documentation:** No clear list of required vs optional variables for each service
- **Service coupling:** Variables were not clearly namespaced by service responsibility

#### Fix Applied
1. Deleted broken `heartfelt-balance` service
2. Created new `fido-slack-bot` service from scratch
3. Added only the 11 required variables for Slack bot functionality:
   - SLACK_BOT_TOKEN
   - SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET
   - CLICKUP_API_TOKEN
   - CLICKUP_TEAM_ID
   - CLICKUP_LIST_ID_ISSUE
   - CLICKUP_LIST_ID_INQUIRY
   - CLICKUP_LIST_ID_UNIT
   - FIDO_CX_CHANNEL_ID
   - CX_UNIT_CHANGES_CHANNEL_ID
   - NODE_ENV
   - DEBUG_CLICKUP

#### Prevention for Future
- **Document required variables** per service in README or .env.example
- **Use environment variable validation** at service startup
- **Namespace variables** by service (e.g., `SLACK_BOT_*`, `WEBHOOK_*`)
- **Create environment templates** for each service type

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Lessons

**Multi-Service Deployments Require Isolation:** When deploying multiple services from a single repository, avoid global configuration files like `railway.json`. Each service should have independent configuration managed through the deployment platform's service-specific settings.

**Version Requirements Must Match Code:** If code uses language features from a specific version (e.g., Node 18's native `fetch()`), the package.json and deployment configuration must explicitly require that version. Relying on defaults is risky.

**Environment Variables Are Not Universal:** Different services have different requirements. Copying all variables from one service to another can cause unexpected failures. Each service should have a documented list of required variables.

**Debug Endpoints Are Essential:** The `/debug/clickup-test` endpoint proved invaluable for diagnosing the Node.js version issue. Adding debug endpoints early in development accelerates troubleshooting.

### Process Lessons

**Verify After Each Change:** After removing `railway.json`, we should have immediately verified both services were running the correct applications. This would have caught the Node.js version issue earlier.

**Test End-to-End Before Declaring Success:** Health checks passing doesn't mean the service is fully functional. End-to-end testing (e.g., actually creating a ClickUp task) is required.

**Document As You Go:** Creating RCA documents during troubleshooting (not just after) helps maintain clarity and provides real-time reference for decision-making.

**Clean Rebuilds Save Time:** When a service is in an unknown state (like heartfelt-balance after variable contamination), rebuilding from scratch is often faster than debugging the existing instance.

### Communication Lessons

**Set Expectations on Complexity:** The deployment took 3 hours instead of the estimated 15-20 minutes. Better upfront communication about potential complications would have set realistic expectations.

**Pause When Requested:** User requested pauses multiple times to prevent overwhelming them with changes. Respecting these pauses improved collaboration and prevented errors from rushing.

**Provide Options, Not Just Solutions:** Presenting multiple solution options (e.g., three approaches to fix railway.json issue) empowered the user to make informed decisions.

## System Architecture (Final State)

### Service Separation

The production deployment consists of two independent Railway services with clear separation of concerns:

**fido-slack-bot Service:**
- **Responsibility:** Slack integration (slash commands, modals, interactive components)
- **Entry Point:** `app.js` (Slack Bolt application)
- **Dependencies:** Slack Bolt SDK, ClickUp API client
- **Endpoints:** `/health`, `/ready`, `/slack/commands`, `/slack/interactive`, `/slack/events`, `/debug/clickup-test`
- **Environment:** 11 variables (Slack tokens, ClickUp credentials, channel IDs)

**fido-unit-ticket-app Service:**
- **Responsibility:** ClickUp webhook routing and automation
- **Entry Point:** `services/webhooks/staging/index.js`
- **Dependencies:** Express, ClickUp API client, security middleware
- **Endpoints:** `/health`, `/ready`, `/webhook/clickup`
- **Environment:** 21 variables (includes all Slack bot vars + webhook-specific secrets)

### Data Flow

**Slash Command Flow:**
1. User types `/fido-issue` in Slack
2. Slack sends POST to `fido-slack-bot/slack/commands`
3. Slack bot opens modal with form fields
4. User submits modal
5. Slack sends POST to `fido-slack-bot/slack/interactive`
6. Slack bot posts message to channel, gets permalink
7. Slack bot calls ClickUp API to create task
8. Slack bot posts ClickUp task link to thread

**Webhook Routing Flow:**
1. ClickUp task created/updated
2. ClickUp sends POST to `fido-unit-ticket-app/webhook/clickup`
3. Webhook router validates HMAC signature
4. Webhook router checks for duplicate events (replay protection)
5. Webhook router determines routing based on VIP status, customer assignment, market
6. Webhook router updates task assignment in ClickUp
7. If anomaly detected (20+ 401s in 5 min), posts alert to Slack

### Security Layers

**Slack Bot Security:**
- Slack signing secret validation (prevents unauthorized requests)
- HTTPS-only communication
- Environment variable encryption in Railway

**Webhook Router Security:**
- HMAC-SHA256 signature validation (prevents spoofed webhooks)
- Replay protection via event ID tracking (prevents duplicate processing)
- Rate limiting capability (feature-flagged, can be enabled)
- Security anomaly alerting to Slack (monitors for attack patterns)

## Recommendations for Future Deployments

### Immediate Actions

**Enable Rate Limiting:** Set `ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING=true` on webhook router after 48 hours of stable operation. This protects against webhook flooding attacks.

**Disable Debug Mode:** Set `DEBUG_CLICKUP=false` after initial monitoring period to reduce log volume and improve performance.

**Monitor Error Rates:** Watch Railway logs for the first week to identify any edge cases or unexpected errors.

### Short-Term Improvements (Next Sprint)

**Add Environment Variable Validation:** Implement startup checks in both services to validate required environment variables are present and correctly formatted.

**Create Service Health Dashboard:** Build a simple dashboard that polls both services' `/health` and `/ready` endpoints and displays status.

**Document Runbook:** Create operational runbook with common issues, troubleshooting steps, and escalation procedures.

**Add Automated Tests:** Create integration tests that verify end-to-end flows (slash command → ClickUp task creation, webhook → routing logic).

### Long-Term Enhancements (Phase 6+)

**Metrics and Observability:** Implement structured logging, metrics collection, and distributed tracing for better operational visibility.

**Service Monitoring:** Set up uptime monitoring (e.g., UptimeRobot, Pingdom) with alerting for service downtime.

**Deployment Automation:** Create CI/CD pipeline that runs tests before deploying to production.

**Multi-Environment Strategy:** Establish clear staging → production promotion process with automated smoke tests.
