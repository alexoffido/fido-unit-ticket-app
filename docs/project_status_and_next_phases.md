## Outstanding Items

### Immediate (Next 24-48 Hours)

#### 1. Monitor Production Stability
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Owner:** Operations/Winston  
**Action:** Watch Railway logs for both services to ensure no unexpected errors during normal operation.

**Success Criteria:**
- No service crashes or 502 errors
- Slash commands respond within 3 seconds
- ClickUp tasks created successfully
- No security alerts triggered unexpectedly

#### 2. Test Webhook Routing with Real Tasks
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Owner:** QA/Winston  
**Action:** Create test tickets in ClickUp to verify the webhook router correctly assigns tickets based on VIP status and customer ownership.

**Test Cases:**
- VIP customer with CX owner assigned → Should route to CX owner
- VIP customer without CX owner → Should tag "Needs CX Routing"
- Standard customer with CX owner → Should route to CX owner
- No customer assigned → Should tag "Needs CX Routing"
- Market-based Ops ticket → Should route to Primary Ops Owner for market

**Success Criteria:**
- All 5 routing scenarios work correctly
- Assignments appear in ClickUp within 5 seconds
- No errors in Railway logs

#### 3. Disable Debug Mode
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Owner:** DevOps  
**Action:** After 48 hours of stable operation, set `DEBUG_CLICKUP=false` in fido-slack-bot service to reduce log verbosity.

**Timing:** October 29, 2025 (48 hours after deployment)

---

### Short-Term (Next 1-2 Weeks)

#### 4. Enable Rate Limiting
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Owner:** Security/Winston  
**Action:** Set `ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING=true` on webhook router service to protect against abuse.

**Prerequisites:**
- Confirm webhook traffic patterns are normal
- Verify rate limit threshold (1 req/sec per IP) is appropriate
- Document rate limit bypass procedure for emergencies

#### 5. Document Operational Runbook
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Owner:** Documentation/Manus  
**Action:** Create operational runbook with common issues, troubleshooting steps, and escalation procedures.

**Contents:**
- Service architecture overview
- Common error scenarios and fixes
- Health check procedures
- Deployment procedures
- Rollback procedures
- Contact information for escalation

#### 6. Set Up Uptime Monitoring
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Owner:** DevOps  
**Action:** Configure uptime monitoring and alerting for both production services.

**Tools to Consider:**
- UptimeRobot (free tier available)
- Pingdom
- Railway built-in monitoring
- Custom health check script

**Alerts Needed:**
- Service down (5xx errors)
- Slow response time (>5 seconds)
- High error rate (>10% of requests)

#### 7. Create Environment Variable Documentation
**Priority:** LOW  
**Owner:** Documentation  
**Action:** Document all environment variables for each service with descriptions, required vs optional, and example values.

**Format:** Create `.env.example` files for each service

---

### Medium-Term (Phase 6 Planning)

#### 8. Build Metrics Dashboard (Fido Pulse)
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Owner:** Product/Engineering  
**Action:** Design and implement operational dashboard for visibility into system health and performance.

**Features:**
- Service uptime and response times
- Slash command usage statistics
- ClickUp task creation rates
- Routing decision breakdown (VIP vs standard vs Ops)
- Security event log (401s, replay attempts, alerts)
- Error rates and types

**Technology Options:**
- Custom React dashboard
- Grafana + Prometheus
- Railway built-in metrics
- ClickUp API + Slack integration

#### 9. Implement Structured Logging
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Owner:** Engineering  
**Action:** Replace console.log with structured logging library for better log analysis and debugging.

**Recommended Libraries:**
- Winston (Node.js logging library)
- Pino (fast JSON logger)
- Bunyan

**Benefits:**
- Easier log parsing and filtering
- Correlation IDs for request tracing
- Log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- JSON output for log aggregation tools

#### 10. Add Automated Integration Tests
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Owner:** QA/Engineering  
**Action:** Create automated tests that verify end-to-end flows without manual intervention.

**Test Coverage:**
- Slash command → ClickUp task creation
- Webhook → routing logic execution
- Security validation (HMAC, replay protection)
- Error handling and fallback scenarios

**CI/CD Integration:**
- Run tests on every PR
- Block merges if tests fail
- Run smoke tests after production deployment

#### 11. Optimize ClickUp API Usage
**Priority:** LOW  
**Owner:** Engineering  
**Action:** Review and optimize ClickUp API calls to reduce latency and API quota usage.

**Optimization Opportunities:**
- Cache customer and market data
- Batch API requests where possible
- Implement request retry logic with exponential backoff
- Monitor API rate limits and usage

#### 12. Implement Log Aggregation
**Priority:** LOW  
**Owner:** DevOps  
**Action:** Centralize logs from both services for easier debugging and analysis.

**Options:**
- Railway built-in log viewer
- External service (Logtail, Papertrail, Datadog)
- Self-hosted (ELK stack, Loki)

**Benefits:**
- Search across both services simultaneously
- Set up alerts based on log patterns
- Long-term log retention
- Better incident investigation

## Known Limitations

### Current System Constraints

**Slack Rate Limits:**
- Slack API has rate limits (1 req/sec per method for some endpoints)
- High-volume scenarios may require request queuing
- No current mitigation in place

**ClickUp API Rate Limits:**
- 100 requests per minute per token
- No current monitoring or throttling
- Could hit limits during bulk operations

**Single Region Deployment:**
- Both services deployed in single Railway region
- No geographic redundancy
- Downtime affects all users globally

**No Disaster Recovery:**
- No automated backups of configuration
- No documented recovery procedures
- Manual restoration required if services deleted

**Limited Observability:**
- Basic health checks only
- No performance metrics
- No distributed tracing
- Difficult to diagnose complex issues

### Accepted Trade-offs

**Debug Mode Overhead:**
- Currently enabled for initial monitoring
- Increases log volume and storage costs
- Will be disabled after 48 hours

**Rate Limiting Disabled:**
- Currently disabled to avoid false positives
- Slight security risk during initial period
- Will be enabled after traffic patterns confirmed

**Manual Deployment:**
- No CI/CD pipeline yet
- Manual testing required
- Higher risk of human error

## Decision Log

### Key Decisions Made During Phase 5

**Decision 1: Remove railway.json**
- **Date:** October 26, 2025
- **Rationale:** Global configuration file caused both services to run same start command
- **Alternative Considered:** Create separate branches for each service
- **Outcome:** Successful, services now independent

**Decision 2: Upgrade to Node 18**
- **Date:** October 27, 2025
- **Rationale:** Code uses native fetch() which requires Node 18+
- **Alternative Considered:** Use axios library instead of fetch
- **Outcome:** Successful, future-proof solution

**Decision 3: Rebuild Slack Bot Service**
- **Date:** October 27, 2025
- **Rationale:** Existing service contaminated with incorrect environment variables
- **Alternative Considered:** Debug and fix existing service
- **Outcome:** Successful, clean rebuild faster than debugging

**Decision 4: Keep Debug Mode Enabled Initially**
- **Date:** October 27, 2025
- **Rationale:** Detailed logging valuable for initial monitoring period
- **Alternative Considered:** Disable immediately to reduce log volume
- **Outcome:** Pending (will evaluate after 48 hours)
